# linux
This files were made with the intention of facilitate my linux use, each folder is a different project, after enter a folder
(github.com/ittca/linux/whatever_folder/) the files are connected, this means they probably need each other.
the singular files ,before enter any folder (github.com/ittca/linux/whatever_file) are just that, singular files with code.

Any code available on this github page follows the free software philosophy.
