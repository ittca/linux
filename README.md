# linux
This files were made for facilitate my linux use and they are available for public use.

On github.com/ittca/linux/ the files are structed with this in mind:
- Folders (are projects with more than one file, probably they are connected and need each other);
- single files.

Any code available on this linux section follows the free software philosophy.
